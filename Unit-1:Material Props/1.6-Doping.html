    <h1>Doping makes semiconductors useful</h1><br/><br/>
    Metals are good electrical conductors, and insulators are poor electrical conductors while Semiconductors are in between. however, they 
    are controllable. It is possible now to grow very high purity semiconductors and reproducibly introduce dopants or defects that are intentionally
    put into the semiconductor lattice to change the electronic properties in specific ways. That's what makes semiconductors useful; that's how we make devices. <br/><br/>

    <h1>Doping a semiconductors</h1><br/><br/>
    <img src="https://www.iceeet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/semiconductor.jpg" alt=""><br/><br/><br/>
    Doping means we introduce other atoms into the crystalline lattice. They are sometimes called impurities but they are intentionally introduced. e.g., 
    we might introduce phosphorus or arsenic into silicon or germanium. and we cud call it N-type or negative doping. Or we might introduce an atom like  
    gallium or boron and we could call that P-type or positive doping.<br/><br/><br>
    P-type dopants come from column III which has three valence electrons while N-type dopants come from column V which has five valence electrons. <br/><br/>
    <h1>N type doping</h1><br/><br/>
    <img src="https://nanohub.org/app/site/resources/2015/12/23337/slides/013.01.jpg" alt=""><br/><br/><br>
    Replace one of the Si atoms in the lattice with an atom from column V, phosphorus or arsenic. Well, column V has 5 valence electrons, so its no problem to share
    four with the four nearest neighbour thereby satsifying those covalent bonds, but there is one electron left over and that one electron now turns out to be very
    weakly bound to the phosphorus or arsenic atom. The binding energy is less than a tenth of an electron volt. It's very easy at room temperature for the thermal 
    energy to jiggle the lattice and break that bond, which produces an electron that can wander around in the crystal lattice.<br/><br/><br>
    <h1>Ionized donor</h1><br/><br/>
    <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/phy4240lec7-141221145531-conversion-gate02/95/phy-4240-lec-7-17-638.jpg?cb=1419195414" alt=""><br/><br/>
    Remember that the fifth electron makes the phosporus atom neutral. We had an equal no. of electrons and +vely charged protons in the nucleus, and the net charge 
    that adds upto zero. Now that we have broken the bond and the electron is free to wander away throughout the silicon lattice, the phosphorus atom is ionized. It's left
    with a net positive charge. We would call this an <b>ionized donor</b>.<br/><br/>
    The concentration of phosphorous atoms is N<sub>D</sub>, the number of atoms per cubic centimeter. What's going to be important thought is the number of phosphorous 
    atoms (or, more generally donor atoms) that are ionized. I'll label that as N<sub>D</sub>, because an ionized donor has a positive charge. Ionized donors have donated an 
    electron to the conduction band to produce the doping that we are after. <br/><br/>
    What is the concentration of electrons in the conduction band after introducing N-type dopants? There were some intrinsic carriers there that were before we introduced
    the donors, about 1 x 10 <sup>10</sup> per cubic centimeter. Typical doping concentration of electrons in the conduction band is very nearly equal to the concentration 
    of ionized donors. It's equal to the number of donor atoms that have donated their fifth electron to the conduction band, n = N<sub>D</sub>+. That's the principle of N-type doping.
    <br/><br/>
    <h4>Be careful about units!</h4><br/><br/>
    We will be working in SI(MKS) units. The carrier concentration should be given per cubic meter, but semiconductor people like to mix their units. 
    it's safest to do calculations in SI units and then convert to cubic cm.<br/><br/>

    n = 10<sup>26</sup>m<sup>-3</sup> -> n = 10<sup>26</sup> 1/m<sup>3</sup>  x (10<sup>-2</sup>m/cm)<sup>3</sup> -> n = 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup><br/><br/>
    <h1>Binding energy of the donor</h1><br/><br/>
    <img src="https://slideplayer.com/slide/15478218/93/images/43/Calculation+of+binding+energy.jpg" alt=""><br/><br/>
    Let's try to understand the weak binding energy of the fifth electron, the one that's left over after the other four electrons share in the covalent bonding process.
    Remember, the hydrogen atom had only one electron and one proton. That's what we have. All of the other electrons have been accounted for in the covalent bond and we have 
    one left over. We have a net positive charge of one and one electron not in a covalent bond. sth like H atom. <br/><br/>
    the binding energy of a hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV. while phosphorous and arsenic in slilicon behave like a hydrogen atom in silicon, one of the important differences is that 
    the dielectric constant, epsilon, is much higher than in vacuum. In fact, the relative dielectric constant of silicon, K<sub>S</sub> is about 12. That quantity is squared. 
    so that's over 100. So the binding energy of this fifth phosphorous atom in silicon is much less than 13.6 eV. Put in numbers and it's on the order of 0.1 eV. 
    Now if you did the calculation a little more carefully and account for details, you 'll find that it's actually even less than that. More like o.5 eV which is a very weakly
    bound electron, easily broken at room temperature.<br/><br/>

    How would we show doping on an energy band diagram? E-band diagrams show the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band
    vs .position. What if we have doped this semiconductor N-type? What changes? What changes is that we have introduced states in the forbidden 
    region where there were no states. <br/><br/>
    Each donor atom introduces a state in the forbidden gap. These are <b>localized states</b> because the electron sits on some specific donor atom; 
    it is located a small energy below the conduction band(the binding energy of the 5th electron). The donor is neutral, but if we break that weak
    bond and release the electron, we now have an empty state on the donor, so it acquires a positive charge, it is now ionized, and the electron is 
    now in the conduction band. <br/><br/>
    Shown above is how we show N-type doping on an energy band diagram. A moderate doping density might be 10<sup>16</sup> - 10<sup>18</sup> donors per cm<sup>3</sup>.
    A concentration of 10<sup>14</sup> would be considered a light doping. A concentration of 10<sup>20</sup> would be considered a very heavy doping.
    about as heavy as we are able to dope it. There's a solid soulbility limit of phosphorus or arsenic in silicon. Remember, however, that the number
    of atoms per cm<sup>3</sup> in Si is about 5 x 10<sup>22</sup>, so even when we dope silicon as heavily as we can, fewer than 1% of the atoms are donor atoms.<br/><br/>
    For phosphorous and arsenic in silicon, the binding energy of the fifth electron is very weak, easily broken at room temperature, so the concentration of
    ionized dopants at room temperature is virtually identical to the concentration of dopant atoms. That means the concentration of electrons in the conduction band
    is also equal to the number of ionized dopants. Remember, the intrinsic carrier density is 10<sup>10</sup>/cc, we've overwhelmed these intrinsic 
    carriers with these <b>extrinsic carriers</b>.<br/><br/>

    <h1>P type doping</h1><br/><br/>
    <img src="https://www.pveducation.org/sites/default/files/PVCDROM/PN-Junction/Images/DOPING.gif" alt=""><br/><br/>
    If we replace one of the Si atoms with an atom from column-iii, we dont have enuf electrons to share with the 4 nearest neighbours and make covalent 
    bonds. One of those bonds is missing. The P-type dopant, the acceptor, is neutral with its three valence electrons. <br/><br/>
    <b>ionized acceptor</b>. When an adjacent electron hops in and fills the missing covalent bond, the boron atom acquires a negative charge. It's ionized.
    It was neutral with its three valence electrons, but now it has got four electrons, it acquires a negative charge but the hole is produced and now is 
    free to move throughout the silicon lattice. Ionized acceptors produce holes in the valence band. If N<sub>A</sub> is the concentration of ionized 
    acceptor atoms, boron or gallium or whatever, then N<sub>A-</sub> is the concentration of ionized acceptors that have acquired an extra electron and have 
    created a hole that is free to move about the silicon lattice. The no. of holes will be very nearly equal to the no. of ionized acceptors. coz again 
    even a light P-type doping will overwhelm the intrinsic carriers.<br/><br/>
     <h1>Energy band view -ptype </h1><br/><br/>
     We can show P-type doping on an energy band diagram too. It works as shown above. It takes energy for an electron to hop from a covalent bond to a state 
     on the acceptor atom. That energy is a liitle bit above the top of the valence band. When the P-type dopant has a missing covalent bond, it is electrically
     neutral. When an electron from the valence band hops up and occupies that site and fills the covalent bond, it leaves behind a hole in the valence band, 
     and the acceptor acquires a negative charge. A light P-type doping would be about 10<sup>14</sup> per cc. A heavy P-type doping as heavy as we could possibly
     do would be about 10<sup>20</sup> per cc. <br/><br/>
     <h1>Deep donors and acceptors</h1><br/><br/>
     One of the thingsthat makes Si nice to work with is that we have good dopants, dopants that are fully ionized at room temperature. If the binding energy
     between these fifth electrons is significantly larger than k<sub>B</sub>T, then it will be difficult to take that fifth electron and move it into the conduction 
     band. Or to take a valence band electron and move it into the acceptor and create a hole in the valence band. We ll call these deep acceptors and 
     deep donors coz they are energetically deep. For some semiconductors the dopers are deeper than they are in Si, so that the dopants arent fully ionized at 
     room temperature. For the rest of this course, we'll be focusing on the simple case of <b>shallow dopants</b> that applies to silicon. <br/><br/>
     <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/gaas-150924090435-lva1-app6891/95/gaas-6-638.jpg?cb=1443085587" alt=""><br/><br/>
     Shown above on the left is our silicon lattice and the gallium arsenide lattice on the right is similar. We dont call the GaAs structure a diaomnd lattice, 
     we call it a <b>zinc blend lattice</b>, but the structure is surrounded four arsenic nearest neighbours and every arsenic atom is surrounded by four gallium atoms.
     The crystal structure of galliom arsenide is very similar to the diamond structure of silicon, it just has two different types of atoms.<br/><br/>
     <h1>Si in GaAs: Two possibilities</h1><br/><br/>
     
     First put silicon atom on a gallium site. Gallium is from Column III, it has three valence electrons. Silicon is from Column IV, it has four valence electrons, so
     we have an extra electron. That means Silicon if it happens to be sitting on a gallium site is a donor.<br/><br/>
     Now, put silicon on an arsenic site. Arsenic is from column V, silicon is from column IV. Silicon has one fewer electrons than the arsenic atom it replaced, so
     silicon on an arsenic site is an acceptor.<br/><br/>
     We call silicon an amphoteric dopant. Amphoteric means it can be either N-type or P-type depending on which atom it replaces in the lattice, and depending on exactly
     how we introduce these dopants, and exactly how we do the annealing, we can favor one site versus the other so can make N-type dopants or P-type dopants from 
     the same element.<br/><br/>
     <h1>carrier concentration varies with temperature</h1><br/><br/>
     Lets take a good shallow N-type dopant. The energy needed to ionize the donor is small, so its easily ionized at room temperature, but if we go down to T =0K,
     there is essentially no thermal energy. All of the fifth electrons would be sitting on their donor sites. There would be no electrons in the conduction band-no ionized
     donors. No extrinsic carriers due to doping. We would also have no intrinsic carriers due to thermal excitation across the band gap, coz it takes an even larger 
     thermal energy to break the covalent bonds.<br/><br/>
     if we heat the temperature up somewhat, we will start breaking those weak bonds and crreating a few elecrtrons in the conduction band. So now we have some electrons 
     in the conduction band. <br/><br/>
     if we heat the semiconductor up to 300K, then good dopants like phoshorous or arsenic in silicon will be fully ionized at 300 Kelvin. We will have 1 electron in the conduction
     band for every donor atom that was put into the crystal lattice.<br/><br/>
     if , however, we continue and heat the lattice up even more, we start breaking the covalent bonds and creating electron-hole pairs by thermal excitation across the band 
     gap. The many intrinsic carriers will overwhelm the doping, and its just as though the doping wasnt ther. When that happens, the semiconductor has become intrinsic then.
     Even though we have dopants in the lattice, their concentration is small compared with the intrinsic carrier density.<br/><br/>
     <h1>Comment</h1><br/><br/>
     At high temperatures, the intrinsic carriers produced by thermal excitation across the bandgap overwhelm the extrinsic carriers produced by doping.<br/><br/>
     Because semiconductor devices are produced by selective doping, the device ceases to operate.<br/><br/>
     Semiconductor devices for operation at hight temperature should be made with materials having large band gaps such as SiC, GaN.<br/><br/>
     <h1>Carrier concentration vs temperature</h1><br/><br/>

     <img src="https://slideplayer.com/slide/17704500/105/images/29/Carrier+concentration+vs.+temperature.jpg" alt=""><br/><br/>
     We can now understand that if we go into the lab and measure the electron concentration vs. temperature, it will have the basic characterstic shown above.
     Near zero kelvin, there wont be an electrons coz there's little thermal enrgy to ionize the dopants or to break the covalent bonds. We call this range of temperatures
     the <b>freeze out region</b>. The carriers freeze out to their dopants and are localized on their specified dopants; there are no free carriers.<br/><br/>
     As we warm the semiconductor up, we begin breaking those bonds and the electron concentration increases. At a high enough room temperature all of the dopants are ionized.
     This is the extrinsic region and we will spend most of the course in this region.<br/><br>
     If we continue to heat the semiconductor, we can get to a region wherer breaking the covalent bonds overwhelms the carriers that were produced by dopants, the 
     semiconductor becomes intrinsic again and the electron concentration increases greatly. <br/><br/>
     This is the basic behaviour of electron concentration vs. temperature. Note that semiconductors can be conducive("metallic") at room temperature and insulating at low temperatures. <br/><br/>
     <h1>S U M M A R Y</h1>

     To dope a semiconductor, we replace a few of the atoms in teh crystal lattice with atoms from different columns of the periodic table . An ionized donor produces
     free electrons in the conduction band, and ionized acceptor produces free holes in the valence band. A shallow dpant is easily ionized at room temperature and is an 
     effective dopant. A deep donor or deep acceptor is hard to ionize at room temperature and is not as effective as dopant. <br/><br/>
     The carrier concentration vs. temperature charactersitc has a freeze out region where the carriers freeze out to their individual dopants. It has an extrinsic region 
     where the dopants are fully ionized contributing carriers to the conduction or valence band, and it has intrinsic region where the breaking of the covalent bonds overwhelms 
     the doping.<br/><br/>
     One of the ways that an experimentalist who is exploring a new material determines whether he or she is dealing with a semiconductor or a metal is to lower the temperature
     to near absolute zero and see if it still continues to conduct electricity. If it does, it's a metal, If it becomes an insulator, it's a semiconductor.<br/><br/>
