<h4>E = E <sub>4S</sub> - E <sub>3P</sub> = hf  (Energy Levels to Energy bands)  </h4><br/>

<p>Atoms probed by exciting an electron to a higher energy orbital and letting it drop down and release energy.
    That energy comes in the form of light. Planck's constant (h) times the frequency (f) gives the energy of the 
    emitted photon. 
    Silicon, the most common semiconductor, has 14 electrons and 14 +ve charges in the nucleus. Electrons reside 
    in a set of states labelled by n=1, 2, 3, 4, the principal quantum nos. Each quantum no associated by set of orbitals. 
    n =1 s is the lowest orbital where we can put 2particales. One with spin up, other with spins down. <br/>
    Put 2 more in the n = 2s orbital. Then for the p orbital we can put 6 as 2 each axis x, y and z directions. 4 electrons
    left. then put 2 in the 3s<sup>2</sup>  orbital. remaining 2 in 3p<sup>2</sup> orbital. Four of the 3p states r empty. <br/>
    Electrons in lowest energy states are docile hence of no interest, however, n = 3 state electrons r responsible
    for chemistry and electrical bonds. These are four of them in silicon. These are <b>valence</b> electrons. There are
    also four empty states in the 3p orbitals. So we 've eight <b>valence</b> states.

    Si atom at each corner, each face enter, four inside along body diagonals. Each Si atom surrounded by 4 nearest 
    neighbours. imp!. The 8 valence states for each atom give rise to a large no. of valence states in the crystal with only half 
    filled. Sharing these electrons with four nearest neighbours effectively fills all 8 valence states. 
    The 8 valence states give rise to 8N<sub>atoms</sub> per cm3 in the solid. That's the basis of covalent chemical bond holding 
    the Si crystal 2gether. Interaction of electron wave fns alters 
    the discrete energy levels of the isolated Si atoms.

    <p>5 x 10<sup>22</sup> no. of atoms in cu.cm of Si. so the same times 8 valence states. but states change coz interaction
        btw orbitals during overlap. Instead of a large no. of dicrete energy levels, the states spread out in energy and they change in 
        energy. Half of the states move lower in energy. These are the bonding states filled with electrons. i.e. valence electronns
        forming the covalent bond. <br/>
        An eq. no. of empty states(the anti-bonding states). These get pushed up in energy and they r available to hold electrons. 
        but no electrons r left. Gap btw filled and empty states. Inside the gap no state 4 electrons. hence <b>Forbidden Gap</b>
        T = 0K. All of the valence band states are filled, all of the conduction band states are empty. and there are no empty spaces 
        btw dem. <br/>
        In an isolated Si atom, the states are localized; the electrons sit near specific Si atoms. In a Si crystal
        lattice, the states become de-localized and spread thruout the entire crystal.</p>

        At T=300K, Si atoms are jiggling around in rand thermal motion. avgthermal energy of 3K<sub>B</sub>/2(Boltzmann's constant) 
        multiplied by T. Coz of thermal energy, probability of valence bands being broken and electrons goin to the conduction band.
        For a typical semiconductor at room temp, only a tiny fraction of the large no. of valence band states r empty. Large no. of 
        empty states in conduction band with its tiny fraction filed with elctrons. Valence bands and conductions bands
        separated by the fobidden gap or bandgap,E<sub>G</sub>.<br/>
        A broken bond produces a hole in the valence band and an electron in the conduction band, so the no. of holes and electrons 
        is equal. Their imp. no. is called intrinsic carrier concentration. Electrons in the conduction band can move abt in da crystal
        & conduct electrical currents. Holes in the valence band can also move around in the crystal and conduct electrical current.<br/>
        Both electrons and holes r types of charge carriers -ve& +ve respectively. Den der is a <b>recombination</b> event. i.e.
        an electron from conduction band dropping down & filling up the hole and going back in the bond.<br/>
        An <b>energy band diagram</b> is a plot of energy versus position. When we draw these energy band diagrams ,
        we simplify them. The empty states in  the valence band are near the top wheras the filled sates in the conduction
        band r near the bottom of the conduction band. SO we simply draw the top of the valence band and the bottom
        of the conduction band  separated by the bandgap. .E<sub>G</sub>

        Light is wave or particle called photon, the energy of each photon given by Planck's constant, h times the f of light. Shine light 
        on semiconductor with high f or short lambda (e.g., blue or violet or ultraviolet), then photons shall 've a lot of energy. With
        an energetic photon, an electron deep in the valence band cud muv way up in conduction band. However, within femtoseconds, the electron
        loses it's energy and drops down to the bottom of the conduction band. These r <b>hot carriers</b>  b4 relaxing 
        2 da band edges coz temp is da way of measuring the energy of a carrier.
